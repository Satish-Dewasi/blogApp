        ref :'User',
        required:[true, 'user id is required']
    }

6. added mongoose session in createBlogController


7. added populate method in deleteController
         
         In Mongoose, the populate() method is used to populate referenced documents 
         in a query result. It allows you to automatically retrieve and replace references
         in your documents with the actual documents from other collections. 
         This is particularly useful when working with relational data in MongoDB, 
         where documents in one collection reference documents in another collection.

8. created a endpoint for getting all the blog of particular user
